Pitch:  
Getting ready in the morning is always a hassle, planing out your day, finding out the trafic,weather, and even getting breakfast done. With this app we will be focusing on getting all of these problems solved in one app. Having a app that works as an alarm, gets the trafic report for the user, obtains the weather for the day, and suggesting a breakfast recipe for the year. This way you do not have to use multiple apps to try and plan out your morning. The target audience for this app is the general public, they will use this app to be able to plan out their mornings more efficiently. Starting off as an alarm clock and providing the user with helpful information and allow the user the plan out their day and future days. This way the user can optimize themselves for efficiency so they do not lag during the morning. The tools that we chose for this project is Xcode, GitHub, Parse, Google Maps API, Google Calendar API, Open Weather Map API, and some kind of breakfast API.
